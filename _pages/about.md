I'm a research data scientist and AI researcher working on interpretability and safety. I have worked in Equity Research as a senior research data scientist for 3 years at [Bank of America Securities](https://business.bofa.com/en-us/content/market-strategies-insights.html), and 2 years as a research data scientist at [RBC Elements](https://www.rbccm.com/en/expertise/elements/index.page), RBC Capital Markets. Prior to that, I was an AI researcher at [VUNO](https://www.vuno.co/en/), working on [VUNO Med®-Fundus AI™](https://www.vuno.co/en/fundus).

I have a MSc in Statistics from the University of Oxford with a thesis on [implicit generative model for graphs](), supervised by [Prof. Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/) and [Prof. Benjamin Bloem-Reddy](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~benbr/). I did my undergraduate degree in Mathematics at Imperial College London, where I graduated in top 5% as Dean's List.

Research interests: statistical machine learning, interpretability, robustness, with applications in medicine and biology.
